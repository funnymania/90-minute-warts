Hello, wartward souls!

Before you start production, there are a couple caveats to be concerned with!

## Firstly, please create your own branch with your username as its name. 

This is what you will branch off of for each wart. 

**Why can we not just branch off of master, and then explore eachother's warts purely by their titles?**

Namespace collisions... If I call my wart 'the_greatest_wart', no one else may be able to, unless it is branched off of something else.
An open question is if we should instead enforce branch naming conventions. 
For example, 'the_greatest_wart' by funnymania is 'funnymania-the_greatest_wart'. 
Enforcement of both these rules is an unsolved question, as well. 

## Secondly, your first commit will be from adding file 'index.html'.
This will signal the beginning of your 90 minute run. For the message of this commit, I personally like to say

### 'Blooms a wild wart'

But you can say what you like. 

## Grow wartward, ho!

Ganbatte! You and your wart will grow together for up to 90 minutes...

## When you are finished, or time is up, please make a commit saying something like 'wart has transformed into the_greatest_wart'

Your wart is complete. Be proud, for there are many more warts to come. :)

## Share your wart with others! 

After it is completed, build off of it with other wartminded people to make it even more amazing. 

## & Explore!

Search through the repo's forks and easily see others warts. Find great warts and show your appreciation by starring or branching
off of them.
